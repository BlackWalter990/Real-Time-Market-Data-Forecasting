# Real-Time Market Data Forecasting

## 📌 Abstract

This project explores **real-time forecasting of financial market data** using advanced sequence modeling techniques.  
Financial markets generate massive streams of high-frequency data, and the ability to **predict short-term trends** provides a critical edge in algorithmic trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management.  

The repository integrates **research documentation**, **model design (TimeXer)**, **data preprocessing pipelines**, and **experimental results**, making it both a research archive and a practical forecasting framework.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **TimeXer** model is the central component of this project. It is designed to capture both short-term volatility and long-term patterns in market data.  

Key features include:
- Efficient **time series preprocessing pipelines**.  
- **Embedding techniques** for auxiliary features like tags or metadata.  
- **Real-time evaluation and forecasting** under market-like conditions.  
- Comparative results showcasing **TimeXer’s advantages** over baseline models.

## 🔬 Research Contributions

- **TimeXer 2.6**: optimized architecture for time series forecasting.  
- **Training methodology**: documented in `Timexer_model_Training.pdf`.  
- **Tag Embeddings**: experiments incorporating contextual metadata.  
- **Results**: benchmarking and evaluation in `Results.pdf`.
